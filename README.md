# DataEngineering_MySQL-to-Redshift-Project

This project was inspired by an upcoming need to move On-Premises data into a Cloud tool for the company I work for

Here's the project architecture:

This is only phase one of the project. I plan to add more things like automation with Apache Airflow and leveraging Stock Market API's instead of manually downloading CSV files to upload onto MySQL.
